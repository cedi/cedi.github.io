Hi!

I'm Cedric, a Senior Site Reliability Engineering Tech Lead from Germany, currently working at Microsoft Azure, where I focus on distributed systems, large-scale reliability, and resilience engineering. My passion lies in SRE principles, including chaos experimentation, release engineering, improving SLIs/SLOs, and cloud-native architectures, ensuring that highly available systems remain robust and efficient.

Beyond work, I was actively involved with the Chaos Computer Club, where I led the GPN Network Team (GPN-NOC) for two years. I’ve contributed to various event infrastructure projects, handling networking, planning, and logistics for events like the Chaos Communication Congress. During the pandemic, I helped build online services like jitsi.rocks and the Kubernetes-powered infrastructure for rC3 - NOW HERE.

In my spare time, I love experimenting with Kubernetes, Linux, Raspberry Pis, and low-level distributed systems programming. I run a K3s cluster on Raspberry Pis and frequently recompile the Linux Kernel to explore new features. I also maintain a CEPH cluster at home for hands-on storage system experimentation and operate a Stratum 1 grandmaster clock with NTP and PTP time servers. In the cloud, I manage a Kubernetes cluster using Cluster API, hosting a full observability stack powered by the Grafana LGTM Stack.

Outside of tech, I have a deep passion for analog photography, collecting 35mm and medium format cameras like the Hasselblad 500 c/m, Leica M6, and Canon A1. I also develop my own film at home and have a darkroom setup with an enlarger, allowing me to fully engage in the film development process.

To stay active, I spend time on the tatami practicing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and powerlifting.

Let’s connect and talk reliability, cloud, or classic cameras!
