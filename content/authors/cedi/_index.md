Hi!

I'm Cedric and I am a Senior Software Engineer from Germany, working at Microsoft on Azure.
I am interested in distributed systems, edge computing, site reliability engineering, and working at scale. I am involved in somme stuff at the [Chaos Computer Club](https://ccc.de) where I led the Network Team at [GPN](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulaschprogrammiernacht) for two years and I help with the builtup, planning, and a million other things at various events trough the year, like the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress).

In my sparetime I love thinkering around with Raspberry Pis. I have a small Cluster of Pis at home running [K3s](https://k3s.io) and a [KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone) cluster running in the Cloud, which I use to [contribute bugfixes to KubeOne](/project/kubeone/) and generally explore more about Kubernetes.

I'm also a passionate photographer and have a small collection of analog cameras in 35mm as well as 120 medium format.
