Hi!

I'm Cedric and I am a Senior Software Engineer from Germany, working at Microsoft Azure.
I am interested in distributed systems and working at scale, specifially site reliability engineering and resiliency engineering.

I am involved in somme stuff at the [Chaos Computer Club](https://ccc.de) where I led the Network Team at [GPN](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulaschprogrammiernacht) (GPN-NOC) for two years. I also help with the builtup, planning (and a million other things) at various events trough the year, most notably the [Chaos Communication Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) at the end of every year.
During the pandemic - when the in-person events where unable to happen - I helped to build online services like [jitsi.rocks](https://jitsi.rocks), [open-infrastructure](https://open-infrastructure.de), and helped building the Kubernetes Infrastructure powering the the [rC3 - NOW HERE](https://rc3.world/2021/).

In my sparetime I love playing around with Kubernetes, Linux, Raspberry Pis, and various other technologies. I have a small Cluster of Pis at home, running [K3s](https://k3s.io). I frequently re-compile the Kernel to try out different features or drivers on my Pis. I also have a [KubeOne](https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone) cluster running in the Cloud, which I use to [contribute bugfixes to KubeOne](/project/kubeone/) and generally explore cloud native technologies.

I'm a passionate photographer and I have a small collection of analog cameras in 35mm film as well as 120 medium format which include a Hasselblad 500 c/m, a Leica M6 and a Canon A1.
Analoge photography for me is even more fun because I (can) develop film myself at home. I have a small dark-room setup with a enlarger for 35mm film.
