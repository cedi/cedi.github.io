I'm just really fucking lazy learning the proper nmap syntax. Nost of the time, I just wanna know which hosts are up, and if port 22 is open for SSH. So yeah, call me stupid, but I actually use this tool almost on a daily base. Sorry to all the nmap fans who feel offended by this creation of mine. But hey - at least it uses nmap under the hood, right? ;)
