KKPCTL is a command line tool written in early 2021 which implements parts of the Kubermatic Kubernetes Platform (KKP) API and lets you access the API via your command line. The way to use it is similar to tools like kubectl. Itâ€™s an open source project hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/cedi/kkpctl).
