summary: The world of container orchestration is often daunting for newcomers! But in this talk we will embark on a journey through the evolution of infrastructure management, from bare metal and virtual machines to the modern world of containers and their orchestration.

abstract: The world of container orchestration is often daunting for newcomers! But in this talk we will embark on a journey through the evolution of infrastructure management, from bare metal and virtual machines to the modern world of containers and their orchestration. After we get to know the history, we will highlight the use cases and talk about getting started in the Kubernetes world. In this insightful and entertaining talk, we'll explore the basics of container orchestration with Kubernetes together. First, let's lay a solid foundation by reviewing the basic concepts and history of this emerging technology. This gives us the necessary understanding to then turn to the practical aspects. Once we're on safe ground, let's take a look at the key steps to get into the world of Kubernetes. To do this, we share helpful tips and insights that will help you avoid common pitfalls and use this amazing technology with confidence. Our first focus is setting up a working Kubernetes cluster. We will show you step by step how you can set up your own cluster and what you should pay attention to. Now that we've covered the basics of building a cluster, let's move on to deploying workloads. We explain how you can successfully deploy your applications and services in Kubernetes and how you ensure that they run stably and efficiently. Using best practice examples, we will show you which proven methods and tools you can use to run your Kubernetes cluster efficiently and securely. We deal with the long-term management of your workloads in Kubernetes. We rely on reproducible deployments based on the GitOps workflow to ensure reliable and efficient use. We explain what GitOps is, how it works and what advantages it offers. We also give you practical advice and examples on how to implement and successfully use GitOps in your own Kubernetes cluster. Overall, this talk provides a comprehensive yet easy-to-understand introduction to the world of Kubernetes and container orchestration. We attach particular importance to the fact that the participants can absorb the information well and put it directly into practice. Our goal is to help you take full advantage of this innovative technology and make your infrastructure effective and future-proof.
