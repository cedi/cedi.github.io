&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m Cedric and I am a Senior Software Engineer from Germany, working at Microsoft on Azure.
I am interested in distributed systems, edge computing, site reliability engineering, and working at scale. I am involved in somme stuff at the &lt;a href="https://ccc.de">Chaos Computer Club&lt;/a> where I led the Network Team at &lt;a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulaschprogrammiernacht">GPN&lt;/a> for two years or I help with the builtup, planning, and a million other things at various events trough the year, most notably the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress">Chaos Communication Congress&lt;/a> at the end of every year.
During the pandemic - when the in-person events where unable to happen - I helped to build online services like &lt;a href="https://jitsi.rocks">jitsi.rocks&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://open-infrastructure.de">open-infrastructure&lt;/a>, or the &lt;a href="https://rc3.world/2021/">rC3 - NOW HERE&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In my sparetime I love playing around with Kubernetes, Raspberry Pis, and various other technologies. I have a small Cluster of Pis at home, running &lt;a href="https://k3s.io">K3s&lt;/a>. I also have &lt;a href="https://github.com/kubermatic/kubeone">KubeOne&lt;/a> cluster running in the Cloud, which I use to &lt;a href="https://cedi.dev/project/kubeone/">contribute bugfixes to KubeOne&lt;/a> and generally explore more about Kubernetes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also a passionate photographer and have a small collection of analog cameras in 35mm as well as 120 medium format which include a Leica M6 and a Hasselblad 500 c/m.
What makes my analoge photography even more fun is, that I develop my film myself at home where I have a small dark-room and even a enlarger for 35mm film.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
